                    When you use the Mobile Application, our servers

                    We act as a data controller and a data processor when

                    carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                    official authority vested in us; (e) processing is necessary

                    process information until you object to such processing by

                    in particular whether the provision of Personal Information
                    is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
                    necessary to enter into a contract.
