                    pre-contractual obligations thereof; (c) processing is
                    necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
                    you are subject; (d) processing is related to a task that is
                    carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                    official authority vested in us; (e) processing is necessary

                    in particular whether the provision of Personal Information
                    is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement

                    payment data with the Payment Processors only to the extent
                    necessary for the purposes of processing your payments,
                    refunding such payments, and dealing with complaints and

                    Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some
